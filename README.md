# Personal C Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal C practice exercises and learning resources from my local workspace.

Contents:
- practice C files and exercises (various folders)
- `LEARNING_NOTES.md` — a living notes file to track topics, progress and daily notes

How I use this repo:
- Commit often with clear messages
- Keep `LEARNING_NOTES.md` updated with new topics and links
- Push to a PRIVATE GitHub repo and update regularly

Next steps to publish (choose one):
- Use the GitHub web UI to create a private repo and add remote then push
- Or use the `gh` CLI:

  ```bash
  cd /home/shinigami/CODE
  gh repo create <your-username>/<repo-name> --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
  ```

If you prefer, I can attempt to create and push the remote for you (you'll need to authenticate `gh` or provide a remote URL/token).
