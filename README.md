# Learning Progress — C Programming & Web Development

A comprehensive learning repository tracking progression from C fundamentals through systems programming, with bonus web projects.

## 📚 What's Inside

### **C Programming Journey**

#### Week 47: Structs & Pointers
- Basic struct definitions and usage
- Pointer arithmetic and dereferencing
- Memory addressing concepts

#### Week 48: Dynamic Memory & File I/O
- `malloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()` patterns
- Safe memory allocation and cleanup
- File reading/writing with structs
- Linked lists and dynamic data structures

#### **Week 49: Student Management System** ⭐
Complete project combining structs and dynamic memory:
- Interactive C application for managing student records
- Growable dynamic array (capacity doubles as needed)
- Search, sort by GPA, calculate averages
- Full source + documentation in `week49/README.md`

**Build & Run:**
```bash
cd week49
gcc student_management.c -o student_management
./student_management
```

### **Web Projects**

#### Graduation Gift Website (December 2025)
- Interactive HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript site
- Date-locked to December 5 (auto-unlocks at midnight)
- Multi-color synchronized animations
- Floating cloud effects
- Friend's message form with Formspree integration
- Swipeable cards for sharing
- **Live:** https://github.com/ricsmwangi/graduation-gift

### **Financial Economics (Reference)**
Exam answers and solutions for actuarial sciences coursework:
- CAPM and market pricing
- Option Greeks and pricing models
- Risk measures and stochastic dominance
- See `week49/SMS3413_CAT1_ANSWERS.txt`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Tools:** GCC, Git, VS Code, terminal
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (web projects)
- **Concepts:** Dynamic memory, structs, file I/O, algorithms, web design

## 📖 How to Use This Repo

1. **Browse by week:** Each `weekXX/` folder is a progression checkpoint
2. **Build C projects:** 
   ```bash
   gcc <filename>.c -o <executable>
   ./<executable>
   ```
3. **Read guides:** Each project folder contains `.txt` or `.md` docs
4. **Study patterns:** Look at `student_management.c` for real-world struct + memory patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✅ Master C fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)
- ✅ Understand pointers and memory management
- ✅ Design data structures (structs, dynamic arrays)
- ✅ Handle files and persistent data
- ✅ Build interactive applications
- ✅ Deploy web projects with zero maintenance
- 🚀 Move to systems programming (next phase)

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Systems programming (processes, threads, sockets)
- C++ transition
- Advanced algorithms and data structures

## 📝 Notes

- All binaries (compiled `.out` files) are in `.gitignore` — source only
- SSH keys and credentials are excluded for security
- Each project is self-contained and runnable
- Documentation provided for every major concept
